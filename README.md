# Security Awareness Training - Misconfigured AWS S3 Buckets üß∫

### Security Awareness Project Overview
This project focuses on Just-In-Time cybersecurity awareness training tailored to 
address specific security risks associated with AWS technologies.

Below are the steps we took to complete this lab.

Step 1:
üí• 
### Identifying the Specific Risk
<br/>
The primary objective of this step is to educate end-users about the risks associated with misconfigured AWS S3 Buckets. 
To enhance the relevance and urgency of this message, we provide a real-life example demonstrating 
the potential negative impacts of such misconfigurations, 
thereby emphasizing the importance of vigilant and informed handling of AWS resources.


Step 2:
üëç 
### Providing Remediation and Solutions
<br/>
Once the risk has been clearly articulated, the next step involves offering practical remediation strategies. 
This includes directing users to specific AWS documentation that details necessary security measures and role-based access control (RBAC) settings. 
This guidance helps ensure that users are well-equipped to prevent or address security lapses effectively.


Step 3:
üìë 
### Effective Communication Strategies
<br/>
Determining the target audience is crucial for effective communication. 
This training is designed specifically for IT personnel, R&D teams, and any individual responsible for configuring AWS S3 Buckets. 

The training material, including a comprehensive video, is distributed directly via email, embedded to avoid external links and ensure ease of access.


Step 4:
üëã 
### Monitoring Engagement and Effectiveness
<br/>
Following the distribution of the training material, it is vital to monitor engagement and gather metrics 
to assess the training's impact. 

This includes tracking who has watched the video, engagement levels, and viewing duration. 

Such metrics are instrumental in evaluating the training's effectiveness. 
Additionally, for those who have not engaged with the material, 
a follow-up reminder will be sent to encourage their participation.
